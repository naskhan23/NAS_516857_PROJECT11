# NasStore (title)

## Description

Today is the beginning of the 8th week of our Full Stack Bootcamp with WAES in collaboration with Code Institute. 
As part of the first project, we need to make static website to demonstrate what we have learned so far. 

I have made this simple webstore, which contains a homepage, productlisting page and a third page with contact.

The online store is built with only use of HTML and CSS.
